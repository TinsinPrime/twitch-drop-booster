<h2>What the HECK is an </h2>
<h1>Autotwitcher</h1>
<p>Welcome to readme.html! Your one-stop shop for an explanation about this website, and the Warframe Twitch drops it's used for. Without further ado, let's go.</p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>The Autotwitcher accepts input and automatically launches a named stream at a chosen time, allowing you to gather drops while away from your computer.</p>
<h3>What do I need to run this?</h3>
<p>You'll want:</p>
<li>a computer running a focused window of Firefox (or maybe another browser)</li>
<li>an automatic drop-gathering add-on installed to the browser</li>
<li>a whitelist inclusion to allow the site to use pop-ups</li>
<li>computer set so it won't go to sleep or power down</li>
<li>Twitch set to allow autoplay in the browser</li>
<h3>Alright, how do I use it?</h3>
<p>If you came here from a link and it automatically started running, congratulations! There should be a timer displayed that will count down to launch. As long as you have the above, you should be free and clear.
<br>
If you went to the main page without that, you'll see two inputs. Write the name of the streamer (such as "Warframe" or "WarframeInternational") in the top and select the time at the bottom. Send, and you're good!</p>
<h3>Additional Tips</h3>
<p>Warframe's official streams happen on the same times on almost every Wednesday and Thursday. These two streams have a collective total: Any minutes spent with WarframeInternational on Wednesday will carry over to Warframe on Thursday. These are also usually the only streams that give items that will help your progress; community streams are almost entirely cosmetics.</p>
<p>The official streams usually offer three drops: One at 30 minutes, one at 90 minutes, and one at 120 minutes. The community streams generally only have one drop at 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If you click the bullet (&bull;), it'll open three new tabs: One at the time selected, one at ten minutes after, and one at twenty minutes after. I use this in case the stream is late to start.</p>
<p>Using Firefox Sync, I'm able to send the page to my computer at home if I forgot. Not a tip for the website itself, per se, but a tip nonetheless.</p>
<h3>I missed the drop.</h3>
<p>I'm sorry that happened. I barely know what I'm doing. For troubleshooting, here are some things that have made mine mess up:</p>
<li>computer fell asleep</li>
<li>Firefox wasn't in focus</li>
<li>streamer started later than I accounted for</li>
<h3>Why did you do this anyway?</h3>
<p>I'd often be driving while the streams were happening, and keeping Twitch up on my phone wasn't terribly safe or efficient, much less keeping track of the time and gathering the drops. Some of the community drops are also associated with Japanese streamers, who are streaming at around 4 AM here. To forego the danger and hassle, I created this.</p>
